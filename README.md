## Front-end

#### Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM)

Allows loosely coupled classes to interact together over common data coming from image extractor classes. It has three separate classes-

* **View** which encapsulates UI and UI logic
* **View model** which encapsulates presentation logic and state
* **Model** which encapsulates the application's business logic and data
